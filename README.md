# P10X#
Be a 10x programmer!

P10x stands for Programmer 10x. Just just like P90x, it contains programs and exercises that will get you to 10x Programmer Rockstar in no time!

With the amount of docs that we read and typing we do it is essential that we are skilled in both aspects as it is what we do all day. P10x helps you to be fast and efficient at both.

We have a typing practice as well as exercises that will help you improve you reading speed

“P10X fans swear by the program, a mix of typing practice, great tips, and saccadic expansion exercises”

Just go to our website and hit the typing practice tab or reading practice tab to get started
