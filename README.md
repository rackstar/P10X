# P10X#
Be a 10x programmer!

P10x stands for Programmer 10x. Just just like P90x, it contains programs and exercises that will get you to 10x Programmer Rockstar in no time!

With the amount of docs that we read and typing we do it is essential that we are skilled in both aspects as it is a big part of what we do. P10x helps you to be fast and efficient at both.

We have a typing practice as well as exercises that will help you improve you reading speed

“P10X fans swear by the program, a mix of typing practice, great tips, and saccadic expansion exercises”

Just go to our website and hit the typing practice tab or reading practice tab to get started

"My typing speed increased by more than 6x and my reading 4x. You have to see it to believe it!

Before P10X: Typing (26wpm), Reading (343wpm)
After P10X: Typing (137wpm), Reading (1214wpm)"
-Johnny J.

"Thanks to P10x, I now feel like the Flash of the programming world."
